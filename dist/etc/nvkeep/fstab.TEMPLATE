# This is the fstab for the NVMesh High Availability Services.
# It contains entries for the file system mountpoints that this host owns when
# all servers are up and running and also the file systems that this host owns
# in case of service failiver from another host.
# Format: The format is the same as in the normal /etc/fstab:
# [Device] [MountPoint] [FileSystemType] [MountOptions] [Dump (0)] [Pass (0)]
# Example:
# /dev/nvmesh/myvolume  /mnt/myfilesystem  xfs  defaults  0  0
